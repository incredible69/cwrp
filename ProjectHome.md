**I am developing a new gamemode called [Flex::RP](http://www.flex-rp.com/) which is a successor of CityWide RP.**

**CityWide Roleplay** is a MySQL-based [SA:MP](http://www.sa-mp.com) gamemode written in PAWN language. Its based on ModernTopia v1.0, it was the first gamemode which uses MySQL - slightly, most ModernTopia's data is still stored in files. We decided to turn it into fully MySQL driven, scalable and extensive gamemode. CityWide stores all its data in MySQL. It makes it very easy to control using a web-based MySQL tool, such as phpMyAdmin. Also, almost everything is controllable even without any knowledge of programming, using admin commands or advanced web-based admin control panel.

CityWide game scripts are released under GNU General Public License v3 (GPL v3.0) and are free for everyone. You may use, copy, distribute, modify and distribute modified programs and its components. CityWide includes, but not limited to the following features:

**Gangs**. Yes, its a lot of fun if you play as lone wolf, but its much funnier if you join a gang. Being in a gang gives you much more possibilities. Each gang has its own HQ, gates (only gang members can open them), cars (only gang members can drive them).

Gang gunlockers. Each gang can store up to 10 guns of the following types: Eagle, Shotgun, MP5, AK47, M4, Rifle and use in case of attacks on their HQ, or for point battles, or for any other purpose. Every gang member can store guns in family gunlocker. Every member can withdraw them.

Gang safes. Every gang member can put money, materials and drugs to the family safe. Only Boss and Underboss(es) can get them from safe and distribute between gang members. Family leaders can also hire materials / drugs runners to be prepared for battles ahead.

Point battles. There are certain points on the map that can be claimed / taken over by gangs. Currently there are 7 points: 3 materials pickups, 3 materials drop offs and 1 drug pickup. If your gang owns a pair of points (Materials Pickup 1 - Materials Drop 1), all gang members can hold 2x more materials per run. Points also can be given / sold to other gangs by Leader of the gang that currently holds certain point. I admit that we stole this idea from another server. However, they stole almost everything from Godfather too.

Property. There are many houses on the map that can be privately owned. When you own a house, you will spawn there. Also you can upgrade your house to restore health and armor. Most probably we will add more features to houses. Also, each house has its own interior. You can set your house rentable so other people will pay you money for living there.

Car ownership. Yes, you can buy many cars that are available for sale. When a car belongs to you, you can lock it so no one else can steal it. You can also give a key to your car to any player(s). If your car is locked, only you or players who have keys can drive it. If you paint your own car with desired colors, it will respawn painted.

Car parking. You can park your own car in any suitable point on the map. Even after server restart, it will spawn when you parked it.

Bank robbery. You can rob the bank if you want. However, its not so easy. Every cop will be on you. If you get skilled by a cop, you will lose money.

Working gunshop. You can buy guns from either arms dealers or Ammunation gunshop. However, prices are different (in Ammunation, guns are officially sold for higher price).

Drugs system. Feel sick? You can increase your health by using drugs. Find drug dealers and buy some nice Weed from them. There are certain actions taken to get rid of drug-spamming (which makes your enemies very hard to kill, and almost invincible).

Realistic economy. Prices for almost everything are close to real life.

Advanced anti-cheat. There is no people with guns pulled out of the ass. There are no flying people. There are no spawned millions of bucks that break the whole server's economy. [DUCK](DUCK.md) anti-cheat program is on duty. You can play with comfort without fear of noob hackers who can turn your life into a nightmare.
